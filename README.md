### Libraries used in the research and their descriptions

Pandas: As the backbone of our data manipulation efforts, Pandas provided an efficient platform for organizing, cleaning, and transforming the collected survey data into a structured format suitable for analysis.

Pingouin: This library was instrumental in performing advanced statistical calculations. It allowed us to conduct Spearman's correlation analysis, offering insights into the relationships between various psychometric scales.

NumPy: Essential for handling complex linear algebra operations, NumPy supported our data processing needs, especially in managing multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: These visualization tools were pivotal in creating intuitive and informative graphs. Matplotlib, with its flexible plotting capabilities, and Seaborn, which extends Matplotlib's functionality with advanced visualizations, together provided a comprehensive view of our dataâ€™s distribution and trends.

RPy2: Serving as a bridge between Python and R, RPy2 enabled us to leverage R's robust statistical and graphical capabilities within our Python-centric analysis pipeline.

FactorAnalyzer: This library facilitated the Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), allowing us to uncover the underlying structure of our psychometric scales and validate their dimensionalities.

Scipy: We utilized its statistical functions, particularly Spearman's rank correlation, to explore the associations between different variables, enhancing the robustness of our findings.

R Libraries (mlr, psych, ineq, BBmisc, ddpcr, MVN, GPArotation): These R packages, integrated into our analysis via RPy2, offered specialized functions ranging from machine learning (mlr) and psychological statistics (psych) to multivariate normality testing (MVN) and factor rotation methods (GPArotation).
